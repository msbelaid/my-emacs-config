* Yet another ~emacs~ configuration file!
  ~Emacs~ î¤¦ is my favorite text-editor, you may ask me why? I can't give
  a reasonable answer! just try it!

  I share here my ~emacs~ configuration so you can use or just borrow
  from it.

** How to use?
   New to ~emacs~ ?
   - Just clone ~init.el~ and ~myinit.org~ files in your ~~/.emacs.d/~ directory!
   - Launch ~emacs~ and wait until all packages are downloaded
   - Enjoy ~emacs~!
** How it works
   - Most of packages are installed using ~use-package~, initialized in ~init.el~
   - Configuration is in ~myinit.org~ file with some explanation.
   - ~personal.org~ contains some personal configurations
** Credits
   - You can find in [[https://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/][Mike Zamansky]]'s blog a bunch of screencasts using
     ~emacs~.
